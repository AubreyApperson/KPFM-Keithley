# KPFM-Keithley

This work supported by NSF Career Award DMR -1056861

Igor code that allows an Asylum Atomic Force Microscope to communicate with a Keithly 2400 sourcemeter to perform KPFM/SKPM at biases larger than the native +/-10V

## LDOS_KPFM.ibw 
A macro that is preset to run the local density of states measurement when loaded with the procedure file kpfmv.ipf
## KPFM Experiment template.pxp
A experiment template that automatically loads all necesary files for the Keithley-Igor communcation for KPFM measurements on Asylum AFM.
